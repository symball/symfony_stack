    <p>By the end of this lesson, you’ll have a basic comments system attached to your blog. Along the way, we’ll be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the comment entity to quickly building a form</li>
      <li>Handling Submission</li>
      <li>Creating a simple notification using the FlashBag</li>
      <li>Adding validation</li>
      <li>Setting the for theme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a Form</h2>
    <p>In an earlier lesson, when we created the comment entity we also created the backend for our form. The Symfony Form Builder takes a data object and uses it as a template for inputted data; this also means it is very simple to pre-populate forms whilst still at the data level.</p>
